    <h2>Stalking the Wild Pendulum</h2>
    <p>This is one of my favourite books. The author combines complex topics on physics, biology, spirituality and cosmology
      all in one working model of the universe. It sounds like an intimidating read but the author uses His
      wonderful sense of humour paired with his childishly charming drawing to make the content easily digestible to 
      the lay reader. 
      I chose to display the chapters of this book to give a rough idea as to what the actual content is within the book.
